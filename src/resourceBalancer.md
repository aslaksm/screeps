# Spec for Resource (creep) balancer

At any point we can access all creeps as an array with `Object.values(Game.creeps)`.
We can also access all creeps with a certain role.

The basic events that the balancer reacts to:

- Stop role: Role is no longer needed. Remove all creeps from role.
- Resume role: A stopped role is needed again. Assign creeps to role.
- Set role importance: how many (of all existing) creeps should be assigned to the role?

Role importance could be an enum:Â [NONE, LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICAL].
Will probably want to increase granularity, but that shouldn't be a problem.

How would creeps be assigned? Ideally, we would allow multiple creeps to be set to critical.

I guess we could do something like:

- None: weighted at 0
- Low: weighted at 0.5
- Normal: weighted at 1
- High: weighted at 2
- Critical: weighted at infinity (but weighted at 1 in relation to other critical roles)

When balancing, we would first filter roles for critical. If any are found, we distribute all among those.
Otherwise, we would sum up the total weights and calculate the # of creeps for each role by diving the weight
by the total weight and multiplying by all creeps.
We subtract the currently assigned # to get the delta of creeps.

- Check for/assign to critical
- Calculate amount of creeps to be assigned/removed to/from each role (using flooring).
- Perform removal
- Perform assignment

Ideally, we'd remove as many creeps as we assign. However, the most important thing is that we remove
_at least_ as many as we assign, hence the flooring.
Since we're flooring, this would probably lead to a small amount of creeps remaining idle.
That's a problem for a later time.
